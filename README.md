# Devixa Tech

**Devixa Tech** is an open-source organization focused on building **lightweight, practical, and quality-of-life (QOL) tools** for developers.

We create small utilities and reusable modules that aim to:
- simplify everyday development tasks
- reduce boilerplate
- improve developer experience
- stay minimal, readable, and easy to integrate

Our projects are designed to be **simple, focused, and useful**, rather than over-engineered.

> Build small. Build useful. Build clean.
